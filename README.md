# Virgin Islands Tourism + History RSS Feed

This repository builds a custom RSS feed focused ONLY on:
- Tourism
- Beaches
- Restaurants
- Shopping
- Museums
- Culture
- History
- Things to do in the USVI and BVI

No local news, crime, or politics is included.

The RSS feed automatically updates on a schedule and publishes a new `feed.xml` file containing curated island articles with real images (pulled from the page’s OpenGraph tags).
